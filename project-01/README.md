## Mini-Project 1

### Description

In this project it was asked that we take one of the provided data sets off of github and explore it while demonstrating skills using techniques used so far in this course. 
That being said, the data set selected was fuel.csv which sparked interest due to personal experience with that content in the description. What was found in the document 
was a plethora of additional information including vehicle type, id, year, make, model, etc. This only worked to benefit the data's exploration. The goal of this project
is to explore the fuel economy through 1990 to 2017. The reason for this is understanding what type of fuel has the most longevity has always been an inner family debate 
and topic of discussion from friends who are looking for cost effective vehicles, this data set can settle it once and for all. In short, diesel has the highest fuel economy 
between itself, premium gasoline, and regular gasoline. This came as a surprise as I was under the impression premium gasoline was not only better for your engine but also better 
on mileage.
