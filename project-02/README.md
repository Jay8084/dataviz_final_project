## Mini-Project 2

### Description

In this project I seek to visualize the GDP in countries versus population density across 
the world using an interactive plot, spatial model, and linear model as per instruction.
The motivation for this is to visualize the disparity between countries in several ways 
so that the impact of the difference in GDP/population is felt by a reader. In addition, 
Trying to see if there is a trend between population and GDP and exploring any nuances in 
this case. What is found is a trend with three different types of countries. These being
countries with low GDP and low population, countries with high GDP and high/medium 
population, and countries with medium/low GDP and high populations. The last finding is 
where the nuance is as some countries have population bloat that is not equivalent to the
GDP. The data used in this summary was CIACountries from *https://github.com/aalhamadani/datasets*.
This data contain country statistics, those being population, GDP, oil production, area, education, 
and net users. These statistics are useful for understanding the state of a country's 
economy and political influence within the world.
